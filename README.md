# Bright Tone Pitch

Service generating Pitch Deck based on the project description

### Financial model
There are two main types of financial multipliers used to estimate the value of a company: Equity Multiples and Enterprise Value Multiples1. 

Equity Multiples:

P/E Ratio: Share Price / Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Price/Book Ratio: Share Price / Book Value Per Share
Dividend Yield: Dividend Per Share / Share Price
Price/Sales: Share Price / Sales (Revenue) Per Share

Enterprise Value (EV) Multiples:

EV/EBITDA: Enterprise Value / Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)
EV/Sales: Enterprise Value / Sales (Revenue)
EV/FCF: Enterprise Value / Free Cash Flow (FCF)

These multipliers are used to compare the value of different companies by evaluating one financial metric as a ratio of another. They provide valuable information about a company’s financial status and can help analysts make sound estimates when valuing companies. However, it is important to note that these multipliers only provide a snapshot of a company’s current status and may not reflect its potential for growth or progress. 

That is why we are adding several additional highlights from the reports: indicators for investors, cash flows and an income statement. With their help, potential investors can assess the expected profitability of the company and be more confident in the guarantee of investments. We also display the main indicators using graphs to visualize the company's development plans.
